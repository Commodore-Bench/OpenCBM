_Description: Kernel module configuration
 The opencbm utilities require a few more steps until they are usable:
 .
 - First, you will need to install the opencbm-modules-source package and
   compile the binary module (preferably through make-kpkg).
 .
 - Install the freshly compiled binary module.
 .
 - Then, check the runtime configuration located in
 /etc/modutils/opencbm.
   Don't forget to run update-modules if you make any changes.
 .
