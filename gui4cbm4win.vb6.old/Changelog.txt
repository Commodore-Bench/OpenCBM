Initial versions 0.06 up to 0.09 by Leif Bloomquist
Adoption to OpenCBM 0.4.0, fixes, patches and additions
by Wolfgang Moser (http://d81.de)

Changes from GUI4CBM4WIN 0.09 to 0.4.0:
    * Added "auto" transfer option
    * Renamed the stdout and stderr log files to g4c4w*.log
    * Extended the "Detect" dialog in the options menu so
      that more than one drive is shown
    * Fixed the "status" action, the return string now
      needs to be taken from stdout
    * Fixed the "dir" action, the status string now needs
      to be taken from the last line on stdout
    * The "Morse" code action is now directed to the
      currently selected IEC bus device
    * Put the sources under the zlib/libpng license to
      clearly define usage and reusage by further
      developers, to make a crystal clear definition of
      this branch of Leif's software beeing OpenSource for
      now and all times without the copyleft restriction of
      the GNU General Public License, but still beeing
      compatible to the GPL and finally to allow
      distribution via Sourceforge. All in all I hope to
      preserve the will of Leif as much as possible with
      that license.
    * Added a "Reset bus" action button to the options
      dialog
    * Added a generalized check for error conditions in the
      commands executor
    * Format action: Added the switches "-v" and "-o" as
      well as the missing "-s" for printing the status
    * Fixed the format action, the status string now needs
      to be taken from the last line on stdout
    * Using cbmforng instead of cbmformat now
    * Initialize: Added querying the status after sending
      the "I0" command
    * Options dialog fix: the selected drive number is put
      to the main window object
    * Options dialog fix: the selected working directory
      patch is taken over to the main form
    * Temporary files are created within the
      Environ$("temp") (%TEMP%) specified directory
    * Added the quiet option "-q" to cbmcopy, so only
      error messages get printed
    * Reomved Leif's eMail and WWW adresses to take back
      support requests from his side. Support should be
      handled by the OpenCBM team as long as a third party
      takes over.
      officially.
    * Added Chr$(34)/'"' quotations to all filename
      arguments given to DoCommand

Changes from GUI4CBM4WIN 0.4.0 to 0.4.0.1:
    * "scratch" command did not work, as a SPACE was left out at the
      command-line. Fixed that.
